       "   'ocr_eng': 'MARY LAND WOMEN’S NEWS\\nSHOULD TEACHERS UNIONIZE?\\n[The following article, which appeared in the current number of The Century, is interesting in that it indicates the trend of the times\\nwith regard to progressive education and the need for organization in the teaching profession. — Ed. Note.]\\nBy Glenn Frank.\\n372\\nSHOULD teachers organize themselves into unions and affiliate with\\nthe American Federation of Labor? This question is to the fore\\nwherever alert teachers assemble. The difficulty of arriving at any effect\\nive consensus of opinion among teachers is due to the fact that the discus\\nsions of the problem have to date failed to deal with the realities of the\\nproblem.\\nNine-tenths of the written and spoken discussions of this issue are con\\nfined to the imperative urge to unionization implied in the glaring needs of\\nteachers in matters of finance and freedom. The nation-wide debate on\\nthis problem has revealed a regrettably uncritical attitude toward the\\nmethod proposed—trades-unionism. With only a few heartening excep\\ntions, those who advocate the complete unionization of the teaching pro\\nfession have frankly accepted trades-unionism as the best immediately\\npractical approach to the problem of industrial and professional relations.\\nIt is true, of course, that many teachers, with an almost senatorial attitude\\nof mind, have qualified the proposal of unionization with many reserva\\ntions, promises that teachers will not strike as teamsters strike, and so on:\\nbut as far as the practical effect of the agitation is concerned, it registers\\napproval of trades-unionism.\\nEven those who oppose the unionization of teachers have, in the main,\\nopposed it upon the hopelessly unreal grounds of professional dignity and\\na supposedly desirable, but actually undesirable, neutrality of teachers on\\nall social and economic matters. I have looked in vain through the current\\nliterature of this agitation for any general recognition of the question that\\nis in the foreground of all fundamental thinking on the modern industrial\\nproblem. The question that is challenging all students of modern indus\\ntry, the question that every teacher should ask and attempt to answer be\\nfore advocating or denouncing the unionization of teachers, is this: May\\nnot trades-unionism as represented by the American Federation of Labor\\nbe a passing phase in the evolution of industrial relation?\\nMy own belief is that trades-unionism, a goodly measure of which will\\nalways be necessary, has about outlived its usefulness as the dominant fac\\ntor in the struggle for better industrial and professional relations. I am\\nconvinced that teachers are today contemplating alliance with a type of\\nlabor organization that enlightened labor will in time scrap in the interest\\nof more statesmanlike organizations and more effective methods. Teach\\ners who today unionize as trades-unions and affiliate with the American\\nFederation of Labor may later discover that the movement that seemed a\\nband-wagon proved a hearse.\\nWhen a penman indulges in such dogmatism, the common decencies of\\ndiscussion demand that he place his cards on the table and frankly state the\\ngrounds of his opinion. Do not jump hastily to a conclusion. This is not\\nthe introduction to a reactionary tirade against organized labor, in the\\nsocial usefulness and imperative necessity of which I ardently believe, as\\nthe reader will later see. Why, then, this cock-sure statement that it would\\nbe a mistake for American teachers to unionize and affiliate with the Amer\\nican Federation?\\nMany opponents of such a move fear that affiliation with the American\\nFederation of Labor would tend to turn teachers into radicals. Ido not\\nshare this fear. My objection to such an affiliation is not that the Amer\\nican Federation of Labor is too radical, but that it is too conservative. By\\nradical, of course, is here meant the habit of going to the root of a problem,\\nnot the popular perversion of the word which makes it mean the habit of\\nmaking trouble for trouble’s sake. The American Federation of Labor has\\ndone, is doing, and will continue to do an immense service for the workers\\nof the United States in improving their economic status; but the plain fact\\nis that the Federation is contributing nothing to the industrial thought of\\nthe time. It is in the rear rather than in the vanguard of industrial states\\nmanship.\\nBut let us look a little more closely into the alternatives the teachers\\nface. Negative criticism of this sort is always a challenge to constructive\\nsuggestion. Let us accept the challenge.\\nMention the Maryland Women’* New* When Patronizing Our Advertiser*.\\nBroadly speaking, there are only two practically possible ideals battling\\nfor control of industrial relations. These two ideals are militant trades\\nunionism and industrial democracy. Between these two there is no half\\nway house that will afford more than transient shelter. In between there\\nis only a medley of palliatives, temporizings and opportunisms. Teachers,\\nwith their growing class-consciousness, must frankly choose between these\\ntwo —militant trades-unionism or industrial democracy. Teachers must\\ndecide definitely whether they are to regard industrial and professional\\nrelations as a problem of warfare between competing groups or as :i prob\\nlem of representative government by co-operating groups.\\nA frank choice of either can be respected and can be made productive\\nof good in the correction of certain immediate abuses, but anything less\\nthan a whole-hearted going over to one side or the other can, in my judg\\nment, produce nothing but confusion and ineffective antagonisms.\\nFor instance, what point can there be to a half-hearted unionization of\\nteachers, affiliated with the American Federation of Labor, but foregoing\\nthe right to strike? This is the proposal we hear on every hand. But\\nteachers’ unions stand to lose more than they will gain through affiliation\\nwith the American Federation of Labor unless they frankly join the ranks\\nof militant trades-unionism and go the whole way on collective bargaining\\nand striking. Such nonstriking unions will sooner or later degenerate into\\nthe same sort of organizations as the old teachers’ associations, which have\\nsignally failed to create professional solidarity, achieve for the mass of\\nteachers better working conditions, or materially improve their economic\\nstatus. Such unions will still be armed only with the weapons of moral\\nsuasion. And the grand adventure of exerting moral suasion is not enough\\nto create and sustain an effective teachers’ organization.\\nA teachers’ organization must possess some more concrete power to\\nwield if it is to be more than an amiable sewing circle passing pretty, but\\npowerless, resolutions. There are only two practically possible ways of\\ntheir exercising such power: One way is by adopting the tactics of col\\nlective bargaining and striking; the other way is by teachers becoming re\\nsponsible parts of a national educational system organized on the basis of\\nrepresentative government, by creating and administering an educational\\ndemocracy to match the industrial democracy that is coming with all the\\ninevitableness of a glacier or the march of the stars.\\nAgain, do not jump hastily to a conclusion. lam raising none of the\\nobjections frequently made to the American Federation of Teachers and\\nits affiliation with the American Federation of Labor.\\nCertain opponents of the American Federation of Teachers raise holy\\nhands in horror at the prospect of its meaning class domination of the\\nschools. But we already have class domination of the schools. It is the\\nclass now dominating the schools that is raising the bogey of labor domina\\ntion. We should probably have quite as good educational policies under\\nthe dictation of Samuel Gompers as under the dictation of some local\\nstreet-car magnate whose major interest is in seeing the school system a\\nsort of institutional paean to the God of Things as They Are. We should\\nprobably get quite as good results from the honest, human, amateur coun\\nsel of a labor leader as from the counsel of the occasional drab-minded,\\nreactionary, visionless business or professional man who—say it softly—\\nserves on our boards of education.\\nOther opponents of the American Federation of Teachers argue sophis\\ntically, like thirteenth-century theologians, that teachers have no business\\nflirting with organized labor, because teachers are not employes; that they\\nare not employes because they receive salary instead of wages. The Amer -\\nican Federation of Teachers can, at least, charge this group of opponents\\nwith an atrophied sense of humor. Perhaps the teacher enjoys a little\\ngreater sense of security as to tenure of employment than does the day\\nlaborer, but in every other sense the teacher’s problem is very much the\\nlaborer’s problem. The teacher is less like the lawyer or physician with\\nhis fees than like the day laborer with his wages. And who can say that',\n",

       "   'ocr_eng': 'SHOULD MANAGEMENT\\nBE UNIONIZED?\\nA Statement by General Motors\\nThe National Labor Relations Board\\nhas ordered a bargaining election among\\nthe foremen and other supervisory\\ngroups of a Detroit automobile company.\\nThis company is not a part of General\\nMotors, but we are concerned with the\\nprinciples involved.\\nThis confusing action by the Board\\nmeans that it is sanctioning and pro\\nmoting the unionization of management\\npersonnel, in spite of the fact that the\\nNational Labor Relations Act includes\\nas an employer “. . . any person acting\\nin the interests of an employer directly\\nor indirectly.”\\nWe are sure that Congress did not\\nintend to approve unionization of man\\nagement when it passed the Act.\\nThe results if applied throughout indus\\ntry would be bad for the management\\ngroups involved, bad for industry, bad\\nfor labor, bad for America.\\nBad for Foremen\\nWe think it would be bad for foremen\\nif American industry should be com\\npelled to make a change in its proven\\ntype of organization, which would un\\navoidably reduce the foreman’s status,\\ndiminish his responsibility, authority\\nand influence, decrease his opportunities\\nfor personal advancement.\\nIn General Motors, foremen have always\\nhad important responsibilities and\\nauthority.\\nWe have always guarded the status of\\nour foremen, and have provided special\\ntraining to improve their abilities, in\\ncrease their efficiency and enhance their\\nopportunities for promotion to even\\nmore important management positions.\\nThe great majority of General Motors’\\nprincipal executives at one time were\\nforemen.\\nWe are convinced that it would be im\\npossible for a foreman to follow both\\nmanagement and union leaderships at\\nthe same time, and under those condi\\ntions to carry on all his duties as they\\nnow exist. All elements of management\\nmust have a common objective.\\nIt would obviously be impossible, for\\ninstance, for him as a fellow unionist\\nwith those under him, to perform his\\nfunctions which relate to their working\\nconditions, wages, promotions and as\\nsignments on the unbiased basis which\\nis essential to good management.\\nBad for Industry\\nFrom our experience both before and\\nduring the war, we are certain that the\\nGENERAL MOTORS\\nAUTOMOTIVE NEWS, APRIL 16, 1945\\nTHE POSITION\\nOF FOREMEN IN\\nGENERAL MOTORS\\nIti General Motors, foremen are the\\nMANAGERS of tbtir departments.\\nThey participate in establishing man\\nagement policies in both production\\nand personnel matters. They hate\\nfull authority to approve or disap\\nprove the hiring, to supervise the\\nuork, and to make uork assignments\\nof the employes under their super\\nvision. They initiate uage increases,\\ntransfers and promotions. They are\\ndirectly responsible for the efficiency\\nand safety of their group. They hat e\\nfull authority u hen necessary to take\\nimmediate, appropriate disciplinary\\naction for violation of shop rules,\\nand other improper conduct of their\\nemployes. They are the prst point of\\nmanagement contact and make the\\nprst management decision on all\\nmatters relating to the employes\\nunder their direction.\\naccepted American method of spreading\\nmanagerial authority and responsibility\\namong foremen—so that management is\\nin close, direct contact with compara\\ntively small groups of -workmen—is the\\nbest and only sound method of handling\\nday-to-day relations with the thousands\\nof employes engaged in modern mass\\nproduction.\\nAnything which would require a change\\nin this set-up would interfere with em\\nployer-employe relations and with pro\\nduction.\\nFor example, there have been many\\nstrikes in war production plants, par\\nticularly in Michigan. Charges have\\nbeen made that workmen have been\\nloafing in plants engaged in war pro\\nduction and that they are being paid\\nhigh wages for not working. We are\\nconscious that the public feels that there\\nmust be something wrong. The attempt\\nto tear down the position and authority\\nof foremen and to unionize members of\\nmanagement is importantly contribut\\ning to this condition.\\nBad for Labor\\nAs a matter of fact, the close-contact\\nmethod is about the only way that man-\\nagement and labor can work harmoni\\nously together in large organizations.\\nMuch is said these days about coopera\\ntion. It would be a serious handicap to\\nany hopes for teamwork and the pursuit\\nof common interests, if anything were\\ndone to remove this facility for knowing\\nand understanding each other.\\nIt is our firm, sincere belief that loss\\nof this close contact would make har\\nmonious relations between management\\nand labor almost impossible and would\\ninterfere with practical collective bar\\ngaining.\\nBad for America\\nThe removal of foremen from their\\npresent position as a vital, integral part\\nof management would require reorgani\\nzation of factory management on a basis\\nfar more complicated and decidedly less\\neffective. Necessary factory discipline\\nwould suffer, worker efficiency would\\nbe impaired.\\nWe believe the effect on you—on the\\npublic as a whole—would be very real.\\nIt would interfere with the war effort.\\nIt would make war materials cost more.\\nIt would slow up postwar reconversion\\nto civilian production.\\nIt would delay adequate postwar output\\nof cars, refrigerators, ranges, furniture\\n—all the things people need so much and\\nhave waited for so long.\\nFinally-and, in the long run, perhaps\\nmost important of all—it would so in\\ncrease production costs as to boost\\nprices and the cost of living, and make\\nthe problem of reasonably full employ\\nment much more difficult.\\nAction Called For\\nWhen people have as deep a conviction\\nabout anything as we have about union\\nizing management, they ought to do\\nsomething about it.\\nIf the meaning of the National Labor\\nRelations Act can be so confused as to\\npromote unionization of management—\\nand thus impair the effectiveness of the\\nAmerican production system of which\\nwe are all so proud—then the meaning\\nought to be cleared up.\\nGeneral Motors believes and hopes\\nothers will feel the same-that it is a\\npatriotic duty, a duty to the foremen, to\\nindustry, to labor, and to the public as\\na whole—to oppose the unionization of\\nmanagement by every proper and law\\nful means.\\nThat is our intention.\\n35',\n",

O’LEARY.\\nA new drive when Congress re\\nturns for legislation to keep Govern\\nment officials from engaging in\\npolitical campaigns virtually was as\\nsured today, when Senator Hatch,\\nDemocrat, of New Mexico made known\\nhe is working on tentative drafts of\\na bill on the subject for introduction\\nat the next session.\\nme new Mexico senators move\\nto prevent any one receiving com\\npensation out of the new *3,700,000,\\n000 Work Relief Act from using their\\nefflcial authority to influence elec\\ntions was beaten in the Senate three\\nweeks ago by only a few votes.\\nWhile that amendment would have\\nbeen confined to work relief expendi\\ntures, the Senator said the new meas\\nure which he is now outlining would\\nbe more drastic and general in its\\napplication to Federal officers.\\nWould Embrace State Employes.\\nThe Senator revealed that in his\\nnew bill he is trying to devise a\\nmeans of having it apply to State em\\nployes as well as Federal officials.\\nHe is giving consideration to two\\nsuggestions in that direction.\\nOne would be a provision that no\\nState agent who receives compen\\nsation directly or indirectly from the\\nFederal Government could take active\\npart in political campaigns.\\nThe other would provide that up\\nfunds could be allocated to a State\\nunder the various Federal-aid grant\\nprograms unless the State has a\\nsimilar law designed to keep its offi\\ncials from influencing elections.\\nSuch provisions would affect a\\nconsiderable number of State em\\nployes, since Uncle Sam is now mak\\ning Federal allotments for a wide va\\nriety of co-operative programs,\\nthrough social security, highway con\\nstruction and other laws. This phase\\nof the bill also would meet one of the\\narguments raised against the Hatch\\namendment in the Senate recently,\\nthat it would place a ban on Federal\\nofficials while leaving State organisa\\ntions free to engage actively in po\\nlitical campaigns.\\nExpects \"Invasion\\'’ Pretest.\\nSenator Hatch expects, however, to\\nencounter opposition to this part of\\nhis bill on the ground of invasion of\\nState’s rights.\\nAs to the general scope of the bill.\\nMr. Hatch emphasised that Its basic\\npurpose will be to prevent officials\\nfrom “using their office or official\\nposition to influence or dominate\\nelections.”\\nPenalties for violation would include\\nfines, imprisonment and dismissal\\nfrom office.\\nSenator Hatch said he believed\\nchances for enacting such a bill would\\nbe much better after the November\\nelections. He also disclosed that he\\nwill make a personal investigation of\\nrelief and unemployment conditions\\nthis summer as a preliminary to a\\nsimilar study by the Senate Unemploy\\nment Committee. He is a member of\\nthe committee.\\nIn his recent amendment to the\\nrelief bill the Senator from New Mex\\nico specifically preserved the right of\\nofficials and employes to express pri\\nvately their political views and to vote\\nas they please. He pointed out that\\nhe based that amendment on the\\nterms of an existing law that applies\\nto employes under civil service.\\n!\\ni\\nFRIGIDAIRE\\nWith the Meter Miser\\nr At No\\nExtra Cost\\nThis Electri^\\nBank Clock ^\\ngiven with\\nevery Refriger\\nator, to save\\nour regular\\nice money.

A. and EMILY BOUCHER . Editors\\nEntered as second class matter October 14. 1343, at the postoffice al\\nNome. Alaska, under the Act of March 3. 1873\\nFriday, August 9, 1946\\nA ONE WAY STREET\\nPRESIDENT TRUMAN, REPLYING TO a sugges\\nm■ tion that exchange visits by Russian and American\\neducators and officials would promote better relations\\nbetween the two countries, said the trouble with the\\nidea is that “it is a one-way street.”\\nMr. Truman told the Young Men's Christian As\\nsociation of Portland Me., which had made the sug\\ngestion to him, that the United States has already ex\\nperimented along that line and has learned it is a\\nprocess of “all give and no take.”\\n“We have been unable to get either newspaper1\\npublishers or professors from this country any travel\\nrights anywhere in Russia,” the President wrote.\\n“The members of our embassy staff are not al\\nlowed to go anywhere without being accompanied.”\\nOn the other hand, Mr. Truman continued:\\n“We have had Russian correspondents, newspaper\\nmen and professors and a great many other people of\\nthat nature over here, and have entertained them roy\\nally, but we never get a return engagement.”\\nIn other words, it is an easy matter to flood the\\nUnited States with curious visitors from Russia and\\nto let them go where they like and see what they want\\nand say what they please both during and after their\\nsojourn in this country—and we have in fact done j\\nthat very thing, as President Truman says.\\nBut it is an entirely different matter, as he iron\\nically reports, when the same privilege is cought in be\\nhalf of American visitors in Russia.\\nWhat few Americans get into Russia at all enjoy\\nno freedom whatever of either movement or observa\\ntion.\\nThey see nothing in Russia except carefully pre\\npared exhibits.\\nThey are not permitted to send any word out of\\nRussia without approval of the Russian censors.\\nAnd after they return home, if they express any\\nopinions concerning Russia contrary to the formal pol\\nicy of the Russian government they are viciously mal\\nigned by the official organs of world Communism,\\nincluding the Communist Party in the United States.\\nPresident Truman has given the proper answer to\\nthe Portland suggestion.\\nToo many American groups view the matter of\\nAmerican relations with Russia as a “one way” pro\\nposition, with the United States extending all the cour\\ntesies and showing all the good will and with Russia\\navailing itself of all the proferred privileges in this\\ncountry but granting none to Americans. «\\nInternational amity is hot to be attained in that\\nmanner, and in seeking to do so the United States has\\nnot only failed to gain access to vital information in\\nside Russia, but has earned only the contempt of the\\nRussian government which has played Americans for\\nsuckers and has been abetted in that purpose by the\\nAmericans themselves. (Seattle Post Intelligencer.)\\nUNIONIZING FOREMEN\\n/CURRENT ATTEMPTS TO UNIONIZE FOREMEN\\n^ in industrial plants throughout America is of inter\\nest to the general public as well as to industry and la\\nbor. /For it is apparent to anyone who will consider\\nthe facts that such efforts, if they are fully successful,\\nwill result in increased costs of consumer products.\\nThese costs, naturally enough, must be relayed to the\\nbuying public and will bring considerable advances in\\nTWO'S BAD COMPANY\\nliving prices.\\nFor generations both management and labor have\\nconsidered the foremen in the shop as management’s\\nrepresentative there. It has been the duty of the\\nforemen to see to it that production levels were main\\ntained; that the “front office’’ received full value for\\nwages paid. Under the unionization program, man\\nagement contends that the foremen would cease to\\nrepresent the employer, and would give first loyalty\\nto the union and the union’s members.\\nHeads of the prosperous and efficient business\\nconcerns naturally feel that, if unionization becomes\\ncomplete, they must install other representatives in\\nthe shops and factory lines. This it seems, would be\\nonly fair and sensible since maintenance of production\\nand the production rules are necessary to the life of\\nany industrial concern. But if management thus is\\nforced to add new personnel to take over a part of the\\nobligations now carried by the foremen, pay rolls cer\\ntainly will be increased. And with increased pay!\\nrolls come increased costs—which the consumer even\\ntually must pay. ,\\nIt seems obviously unfair to business to ask it to\\nsacrifice all representation on factory lines—and that;\\nis what unionization of foremen would mean. But'\\nit would not be unfair to management alone. America\\nas a whole would suffer—suffer through decreased\\nproduction and increased prices.

Gastonia and the High Shoals Mills near Gastonia are\\ngoing out of business, throwing 4,000 people out of work and\\nshutting off a payroll of $48,000 per week.\\n“After two strikes, neither oil\\nwhich were justified, the owners\\nof the Loray Mills at Gastonia, N\\nC., and the High Shoals Mills, lo\\ncated about six miles from Gas\\ntonia, have decided to liquidate\\nand are running out the stock-in\\nprocess.\\nThe weekly payroll of the Loray\\nMills was about $40,000 and that\\nof the High Shoals Mill about\\n$8,000. This $48,000 pep week\\nwent very largely to the merchants\\nof Gastonia and flowed through\\nthe channels of business. It will\\nbe greatly missed.\\nAbout 3,600 mill employees at\\nthe Loray Mills and 500 at High\\nShoals are out of work and they\\nand their families will be in dis\\ntress unless they can find work ai\\nother mills, most of which already\\nhave all the operatives they need\\nThe men who forced the clos\\ning of these mills, upon two occa\\nsions, have gone to other fields\\nand those who are out of wort\\nbecause of their influences can ex\\npect no help from them.\\nThe tragedy is that not over 2C\\nper cent of thosej who are now\\nfaced with the loss of their jobs\\ngave any support to either strike.\\nThey were the victims of an or\\nganize^ mob who under the leader\\nship of rank outsiders forced the\\nmills to close.\\nWhat has happened at the Loray\\nand High Shoals mill has happened\\nmany times in New England.\\nFor twenty-five years New Eng\\nland cotton mills were union\\nized, and during that time some\\nmills were always closed as the\\nresult of strikes, orgnaized by the\\nUnited Textile Workers.\\nIn 1910 New England had 21,\\n000,000 spindles, but as the re\\nsult of operations being made un\\nprofitable by reason of continual\\nstrikes, or losses incident thereto,\\nmills went out of business and\\nwejre dismantled until 1930, New\\nEngland had only 10,700,000 spin\\ndles and only about 7,500,000 of\\nthem were in operation.\\nMore than 100,000 cotton mill\\nemployees had seen thejir jobs dis\\nappear as the result of spindles\\nand looms being scrapped or mov\\ned elsewhere.\\nAt the end of twenty-five years\\nof union domination, the employees\\nof New England mills were receiv\\ning less wages in proportion to\\nthe cost of living than mill em\\nployees in the South where unions\\nhad not been established.\\nTwo-thirds of the* mill opera\\ntives in New England had lost\\ntheir jobs as the result of union\\ndomination, but had not a single\\nbenefit to show as the result of\\nunion affiliation.\\nWhat has happened at Loray and\\nHigh Shoals is but a shadow of\\nwhat will happen if cotton mill\\noperatives follow the leadership of\\nsuch men as Thos. F. McMahon\\nor Francis J. Gorman.\\nMen will not continue to operate\\ncotton mills unless then can earn\\nprofits and mills can not be pro\\nfitable when operated under the\\nconstant threat of strikes.\\nThe cotton mills of England\\nHit by Ickes Order I\\nNEW YORK . . . Robert Moses\\n(above), Park Commissioner here,\\nhas been put on the spot by Secre\\ntary Ickes of the Interior Depart\\nment who ordered that all municipal\\nofficials must quit posts in which\\nFederal funds are involved. Beside\\nbeing park commissioner, Mr. Moses\\nis a member of the Tri-Boro Bridge\\nAuthority, using federal funds.\\nhave) been completely unionized fo:\\ntextile, wages in England are today\\nmore than thrity years and yet\\nfar lower than those in our mills.\\nAs the result of union domina\\ntion English cotton manufacturers\\nhave been slow to invest money in\\nnew machinery and within the past\\nfew years mills with more than\\n6,000,000 spindles have been dis\\n•mantled.\\nThe Textile Bulletin has been\\npictured to the cotton mill opera\\ntives of the South as fighting the\\nunionization of Southern cotton\\nmills because we were against the\\nworking man, but that charge is\\nnot true. We have always opposed\\nwage reductions and have always\\nfought for good living conditions\\nfor cotton mill employees.\\nHaving seen the, United Textile\\nWorkers wreck the cotton textile\\nindustry of New England and throw\\nmore than 100,000 mill employees\\nout of work and having seen or\\nganizejd labor prevent a further\\ndevelopment of cotton mills in\\nEngland and start it upon a pro\\ncess ol dismantlement, we are de\\ntermined to do our best to prevent\\nsuch a tragedy being repeated in\\nour own section.\\nThe liquidation of Loray and\\nHigh Shoals plants is but an ex\\nample of what wei have feared and\\nwhat will spread if the United Tex\\ntile Workers get control of the\\nSouth.\\nIf they do ge.t control, the day\\nwill come when a hundred thou\\nsand of those who are now living\\nin comfortable mill houses, re\\nceiving pay envelopes every week\\nand seeing their children educated\\nin good schools, will be back upon\\ntenant farms, without any modern\\nconveniences and trying to eke out\\na meager existence through the\\nhard labor of every member of the\\nfamily.\\nThe United Textile Workers of\\nfer unionism to cotton mill oprea\\ntives and all that they show is\\nthat it wrecked the New England\\ntextile industry and threw 100,\\n000 pepple out of work and that\\nit has recently taken a toll of 6,\\n000,000 spindles in England.\\nIf we thought that unionization\\nwould benefit the cotton mill em\\nploy es of the South, we would\\nsupport unionization, but having\\nviewed its work in New England\\nand in England, we could not bi\\ntrue to the textile industry of the\\nSouth if we did not fight with\\nevery ounce of our energy, a\\nmovement from which we, see only\\ndistr ss and tragedy.\\nOver 4,000 mill employees at\\nGastonia and High Shoals are, f:\\\\c\\ning the loss of the jobs with which\\nthey supproted their families.\\nThe merchants of Gastonia, one\\nof the finest and most progressiv\\ncities of the South, face the 'o.«\\nof a payroll of approximately $48,\\n000 p r week.\\nIt is but a repetit'on of what has\\nhappened at many cities and towns\\nin New England.\\nIn spite of the charges directed\\ntowards us by union organizers,\\nw shall continue to fight against\\na'.l efforts to place our mills under\\nthe domination of textile unions.\\nPerhaps, if some one had fought\\na similar battle in New Eng and\\nthe 10).000 mill employees who\\nsaw their spindles and looms dis\\nmantled would still be operating\\nthem and receiving weekly pay\\nenvelopes.”\\nHosts to Club\\nMr. and Mrs. T. B. Mannam?\\nentertained their bridge c'ub\\nThursday evening at their home\\non Elm street, in Weldon. The\\ntop score prizes were awarded to\\nMrs. Malvern King and Dr. W. A\\nCarter.

McKinnon, owner of a\\nchain of restaurants located at 22 S.\\nWabash, 232 W. Madison, 143 N. Wa\\nbash and 25 W. Van Buren was put\\non the stand by the restaurant keep\\ners to tell what he knew of the at\\ntempts of the waitress union to\\nunionize his shops.\\nUnder direct examination Ir Mc\\nKinnon displayed touching loyalty to\\nlabor His sole reason for not -wishing\\nto sign a union contract as stated\\nby himself was that some of his wait\\nreseeswho had conditions even more\\nideal, he was sure, than they could\\nobtain under a closed shop agree\\nment threatened to leave his employ\\nnothwithstanding these ideal condi\\ntions if he signed up with the union\\nand he did not care to lose his faith\\nful employes. Otherwise he was very\\nsure lie had no feeling against union\\nlabor and would as soon employ a\\nunion waitress as a non-union one.\\nUpon cross examination by Mr.\\nThompson, however, McKinnon's\\nviews seemed to change. He admit\\nted he had been one of the pioneers\\nin organizing the Chicago Food Ex\\nchange, a combination of lunchroom\\nand restaurant men not already affi\\nliated with the Hotel and Restaurant\\nKeepers Association who met either\\nJo-affiliate- with, that organization to\\nsecure its assistance in fighting union\\nlabor or to organize another organi\\nzation with the same purpose.\\nMcKinnon said he was elected pres\\nident of the restaurant keeper's union\\nat the second meeting and acted as\\nchairman at the first. He stated the\\npurpose of the organization was to\\nprotect the members from being\\nforced to sign with union labor, but\\nMcKinnon did not hke to have the\\ncapitalistic union called a union; lie\\npreferred that it be called an associa\\ntion and he cavilled over the sugges\\ntion that it was intended to fight\\nunion labor and preferred that it was\\nto protect the restaurant meh from\\nany neccessity of recognizing union\\nlabor. He admitted that his restaur\\nant keepers' union was formed in\\nFebruary previous to the breaking of\\nthe union contract by Knab. He\\nstated that the men who formed the\\nChicago Food Exchange Ass'n were\\nthe guests of the Restaurant Keep\\ners' Ass'n at their initial meeting and\\nthat among tnose present were\\nPhilip Henrici, Kunz of Kunz-Remn-ler\\nand Vogelsang.\\nMcKinnon was followed on the\\nstand by Henry Heibel, owner of res-\\nItaurants at 209 S LaSalle, 805 -S.\\nHalsted and 227 W. Van Buren st.\\nHeibel was another employer who\\nsaid he had an absolutely open mind\\nconcerning union labor, his only ob\\njection to it being that he felt his\\nvalued employes should not be com\\npelled to join any organisation. How\\never, Heibel signed an agreement 1\\nwith the union covering a period of, a\\nfew months and then followed Knab s\\nexample in refusing to renew that\\nagreement once he had become a\\nmember of the restaurant keepers'\\nunion.\\nL.

He said\\nhe was sure there would be no oppo\\nsition to the bill if it could be made\\nto include men as well as women and\\nminors, and in the next breath stated\\nthat men were unalterably opposed\\nto it because they were able to get\\nbetter wages by unionization. He\\nsaid that before such a law was pass\\ned it should be submitted to a refer\\nendum vote by the people and then\\ndeclared it would be impossible to\\never pass the initiative and referen\\ndum which would enable them to so\\nvote.\\nSenator Denvir, chairman of the\\ncommittee, asked Taylor if there was\"\\nanything he and the bosses would\\nconsider or if they were simply op\\nposed to any standardization of\\nwages and Taylor said they were so\\nopposed.\\n\"The esnate committee which in\\nvestigated wages here two years ago\\ndiscovered that girls were working\\nfor as low as $4 a week,\" Denvir\\nstated. \"You have been criticizing\\nthis bill. Do you believe they should\\nbe compelled to work for $3 or $4 \\'or.\\nwhatever they can get.

Or maybe he is\\nmerely carrying\\' out his policy of\\nbeing a spoke in the Democratic\\'\\nwheel.\\nWhy should the American working\\nclass go into hysterics over the alleg\\ned issues of the present submarine\\ncontroversy? Right here at home\\nwe have a far more insudious attack\\nupon our most elementary rights.\\nGarment workers here are out on\\nstrike, asking primarily for their re- a\\ncognition as an organization, so they w\\ncan protect their members and also\\nfor increased wages which they cer\\n\\'tainly should get Judge Baldwin,\\nwho is paid only $12,000 a year (gar-\\nment workers who get one-tenth that\\nmuch could be numbered on the\\nfingers of one hand), has issued an\\ninjunction forbidding the unionists\\nfrom doing almost everything except\\nto live in the same city with the\\nstrikebreakers. Several items as re\\nported by the papers will sufficiently\\nshow the arbitrary power assumed\\nby this judge. The garment workers\\ncannot \"watch the garment fac\\ntories.\" What ridiculous rot I won\\nder if he would arrest a worker for\\ntaking a long distance view through\\na telescope.\\n\"From doing anything subjecting\\nthose who stayed at work to criti\\ncism, censure or annoyance because\\nthey stay at work.\" A strike can be\\nwon only by using all possible means\\nof \\'social pressure to keep the work\\ners away from their machines. The\\nabove clause if enforced would kill\\nall labor organization. It is the duty\\nof every liberal, of every working\\nman or woman and their friends to\\nhelp the garment workers carry out\\ntheir defiance of an injunction which\\nso grossly forfeits the freedom of\\nspeech and action won at so great a\\ncost by decades of agitation. Right\\nhere at home is our fight. Rights in-\\nfinitely more precious to the preser\\nvation of this nation are being out\\nrageously trampled under foot daily\\nby those who are hoodwinking the\\npublic by arousing a war spirit to\\nconceal their own traitorous looting\\nof the public treasury. Let the mas\\nters of American society be a little\\ncareful to arousing the war feeling,',\n",
